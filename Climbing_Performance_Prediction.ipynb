So, basically the Non-Linear model's predictions are closer to reality. By being little more a accurate, I belive the Non-Linear model potentially identified complex data relationships that the Linear model could pick up on. But, when we look at the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we see that the Non-Linear model had slightly higher statistics compared to the Linear one. This means that while it generally gets closer to real values in prediction, it may also suffer from larger errors in some cases."

        "We can conclude that the Non-Linear model had a slightly lower MAE which makes it look like it's better at handling the complex relationships between climbers and their performance. However, with an increased MSE and RMSE, there's a chance that while the average errors are lower, the variability of those errors is higher. This project shows how difficult it was to predict climbing performance.\n",
